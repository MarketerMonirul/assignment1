                <p>The recent flood has caused devastation to many families in various communities throughout Quebec.
                    Despite the heartache
                    it’s been heart-warming to see communities come together in order to support flood victims. Many of
                    us are donating food
                    to help families in need. Several of my clients have asked for advice on the types of non-perishable

            <h1>A little help will improve their lives</h1>
            <p>As most people are well aware, the immediate impacts of flooding include loss of human life, damage to
                property,
                destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne
                diseases. As
                communication links and infrastructure such as power plants, roads and bridges are damaged and
                disrupted, some economic
                activities may come to a standstill, people are forced to leave their homes and normal life is
                disrupted.imilarly, disruption to industry can lead to loss of livelihoods. Damage to infrastructure
                also causes long-term
                impacts, such as disruptions to supplies of clean water, wastewater treatment, electricity, transport,
                communication,
                education and health care. </p>
